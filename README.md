## How the internet works

The first stage is application

There are several protocols in the application stage

- WWW

- SMS
 
- IRC

- EMAIL

- VOIP

This stage turns your request into binary

 
 
 
The next stage is transport

This stage breaks your binary into packets

- TCP(Slower but includes all packets and makes sure it isnt missing anything)

- UDP(Faster and includes mistakes, used for streaming, phone calls, etc)



 
 
 
The next stage is the Internet

This is what transfers the packets to the Link/Network


 
 
 
Of course the last one is the Link/Network page which takes your binary and turns it into physical data
