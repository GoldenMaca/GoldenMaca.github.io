# Project Development Process

## Week 1

We made a drawing where we were going to try to do the following for each container. (I have a physically drawn image)

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Welcome Page | Make a welcome page, using parallax to show a work of hers in the background. This would have a button to slide to the next area. |
| About Me | An 'About me' page, giving a brief description of who she is and button that leads to the first of two subpages. |
| Gallery | A page where the user can interact with two 'cards' showing her work. Then the user would be able to go to a gallery subpage and see a more expanded gallery of her works. |
| Contact | A contact container (which would be a form). At this point I hadn't found a database, but I'll do that later. This would just consist of an email input and a message. |
| Socials | A page, linking to her socials (I am leaving these buttons blank for her online safety). These buttons would ideally have icons to look cooler but that is just another thing, so we'll see. |
| Footer | A footer, just making a copyright icon to look more professional. |

She wants muted colors because she likes them and thinks they will be less distracting.

## Week 2

Today I showed my mom the completed first page, she liked it but requested to change the colors. I agreed to change them when I found the time.

Then we discussed the sub pages. We talked about the gallery page, and I suggested we keep the navbar on all the pages for smooth navigation. She agreed. I then suggested a 'paper-like' design for her bio, making another div in front of the background that would hold all of the content (it would have a shadow).
