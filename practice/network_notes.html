    <h2>Packets</h2>
    <p>Data is of course in all different sizes. 
        And yet, data is sent through the internet
         in all the same sizes.</p>
    <p>The way data is sent in all the same sizes
        is by breaking it up into smaller pieces, 
        called packets. Each packet is sent separately, 
        and then reassembled at the destination.</p>

    <h2>IP Adresses</h2>
    <p>Every device connected to the internet has an IP address.
         This is like a mailing address for your computer. 
        It tells other computers where to send data.</p>
    <p>IP adresses are connected and packets are sent through 
        them to get the message to the final destination.</p>

    <h2>Protocol</h2>
    <p>Protocol is rules that must be abbided by in order to 
        send and recieve packets.
