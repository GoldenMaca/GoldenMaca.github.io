			<h2>2. Know where you are</h2>
			<p>Knowing what you are accessing is quite important, especially if you are lost. If you need to know which directory you are in, or even what file you are accessing, type: <samp>pwd</samp></p>
			<p>This stands for <q>print working directory</q> which will tell you exactly where you are.</p>
